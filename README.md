# USER STORY
### Visitor to the website


# STRUCTURE



# DESIGN
### Typography
I chose Source Code Pro from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as I felt it went well with the theme of the quiz and the coding challenge.

### Color Palette
I wanted to keep the color pallette simple, utilising the colors within the main logo.


### Icons
The only icon I used in the project was the Crown icon for the High Scores button and was from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
